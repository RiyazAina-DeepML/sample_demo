# Steps to train instance segmentation on own dataset using mmdetect library

1.Create new repository with "any name"
	ex- "instance_Seg_repo_on_tomato"

2.add data folder inside empty repository created in step 1.
	a.data folder contains images folder where all images present
	b. along with the trainval.json file which contains annotations of all instances for images folder in coco format only.

3.keep the "train_instance_segmentation_notebook.ipynb" notebook file inside the repository so we can upload it on google colab to run there.

4. run git submodule add "https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git"
5.run git add --all 
6. run git commit -m "add your own message"
7. run git push 
8. open notebook "train_instance_segmentation_notebook.ipynb" in google colab
9.make changes in git_repo_url = "to your repo url created in step 1"
10.inside CONFIG FILE CELL , change the path of data root to your data folder path and 
11.after "%%writefile" in the same cell provide the path of config file of "mask-rcnn" or any other architecture

12.to start training run train.py file inside the tools folder 

	"!python3 /content/sample_demo/mmdetection/tools/train.py  /content/sample_demo/mmdetection/configs/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py /content/mmdetection_instance_segmentation_REPO/mmdetection/configs/mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_1x.py" 
	a. input argument is path "to config file of model" which is used for instance segmentation

13. change dircetory path to mmdetection folder and run !python3 setup.py develop
	ex-%cd /content/mmdetection_instance_segmentation_REPO/mmdetection

14. test model using saved checkpoint inside "workdirs" folder
